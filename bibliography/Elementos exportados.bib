	abstract = {Controlled experiments are generally carefully designed to allow revealing statistical analyses to be made using straightforward computations. The estimates, standard errors, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) table corresponding to most designed experiments are easily computed because of balance in the design. This chapter assumes that the design matrix based on the complete cases is positive definite. In that case, the equations applied to the r units with yi observed define the correct least squares estimates, standard errors, sums of squares, and F tests when faced with missing data. The chapter describes how to implement the missing-value covariate method to calculate least squares estimates of m missing values using only complete-data ANOVA routines and a routine to invert an m x m symmetric matrix.},
