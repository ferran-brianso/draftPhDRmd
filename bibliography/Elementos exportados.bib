	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is popular in dealing with missing data problems particularly for non-ignorable missingness, where full-likelihood method cannot be adopted. It analyses how sensitively the conclusions (output) may depend on assumptions or parameters (input) about missing data, i.e. missing data mechanism. We call models with the problem of uncertainty sensitivity models. To make conventional sensitivity analysis more useful in practice we need to define some simple and interpretable statistical quantities to assess the sensitivity models and make evidence based analysis. We propose a novel approach in this paper on attempting to investigate the possibility of each missing data mechanism model assumption, by comparing the simulated datasets from various MNAR models with the observed data non-parametrically, using the K-nearest-neighbour distances. Some asymptotic theory has also been provided. A key step of this method is to plug in a plausibility evaluation system towards each sensitivity parameter, to select plausible values and reject unlikely values, instead of considering all proposed values of sensitivity parameters as in the conventional sensitivity analysis method. The method is generic and has been applied successfully to several specific models in this paper including meta-analysis model with publication bias, analysis of incomplete longitudinal data and mean estimation with non-ignorable missing data.},

	abstract = {In omics data integration studies, it is common, for a variety of reasons, for some individuals to not be present in all data tables. Missing row values are challenging to deal with because most statistical methods cannot be directly applied to incomplete datasets. To overcome this issue, we propose a multiple imputation (MI) approach in a multivariate framework. In this study, we focus on multiple factor analysis (MFA) as a tool to compare and integrate multiple layers of information. MI involves filling the missing rows with plausible values, resulting in M completed datasets. MFA is then applied to each completed dataset to produce M different configurations (the matrices of coordinates of individuals). Finally, the M configurations are combined to yield a single consensus solution.},

	abstract = {Missing data is a common problem in general applied studies, and specially in clinical trials. For implementing sensitivity analysis, several multiple imputation methods exist, like sequential imputation, which restricts to monotone missingness, and Bayesian, where the imputation and analysis models differ, entailing overestimation of variance. Also, full conditional specification provides a conditional interpretation of sensitivity parameters, requiring further calibration to get the desired marginal interpretation. We propose in this paper a multiple imputation procedure, based on a multivariate linear regression model, which keeps compatibility in sensitivity analysis under intermittent missingness, providing a marginal interpretation of the elicited parameters. Simulation studies show that the method behaves well with longitudinal data and remains robust under demanding constraints. We conclude the possibility of situations not covered by the existing methods and well suited for our proposal, which allows more efficient handling of a given multivariate linear regression structure. Its use is illustrated in a real case study, where a sensitivity analysis is accomplished.},
