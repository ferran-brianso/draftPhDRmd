	abstract = {In the context of systems biology, few sparse approaches have been proposed so far to integrate several data sets. It is however an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as to understand the mutual interactions between the different data sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial to give interpretable results. We focus on a sparse Partial Least Squares approach (sPLS) to handle two-block data sets, where the relationship between the two types of variables is known to be symmetric. Sparse PLS has been developed either for a regression or a canonical correlation framework and includes a built-in procedure to select variables while integrating data. To illustrate the canonical mode approach, we analyzed the NCI60 data sets, where two different platforms (cDNA and Affymetrix chips) were used to study the transcriptome of sixty cancer cell lines.},

	abstract = {Rapid development of DNA microarray technology has resulted in different laboratories adopting numerous different protocols and technological platforms, which has severely impacted on the comparability of array data. Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. CIA simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. CIA can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The functional interpretation of microarray datasets still represents a time-consuming and challenging task. Up to now functional categories that are relevant for one or more experimental context(s) have been commonly extracted from a set of regulated genes and presented in long lists.Results: To facilitate interpretation, we integrated Gene Ontology (GO) annotations into Correspondence Analysis to display genes, experimental conditions and gene-annotations in a single plot. The position of the annotations in these plots can be directly used for the functional interpretation of clusters of genes or experimental conditions without the need for comparing long lists of annotations. Correspondence Analysis is not limited in the number of experimental conditions that can be compared simultaneously, allowing an easy identification of characterizing annotations even in complex experimental settings. Due to the rapidly increasing amount of annotation data available, we apply an annotation filter. Hereby the number of displayed annotations can be significantly reduced to a set of descriptive ones, further enhancing the interpretability of the plot. We validated the method on transcription data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Availability: The M-CHiPS software is accessible for collaborators at http://www.mchips.orgContact:  c.busold@dkfz.deSupplementary information:  http://www.dkfz.de/mchips/supplements/supplement\_busold\_bioinf\_OS.pdf},

This article reviews relevant concepts in omics data integration using systems biology, a mathematical modelling method that globally describes a biological system on the basis of its modules and the functional connections that govern their behaviour. The review describes key databases and bioinformatics tools, as well as the challenges and limitations of the current state of the art, along with practical application to CKD therapeutic target discovery. Moreover, it describes how systems biology and visualization tools can be used to generate clinically relevant molecular models with the capability to identify specific disease pathways, recognize key events in disease development and track disease progression.},

Recently, it was discovered that miRNAs are presented in peripheral circulation abundantly and stably. This has raised the possibility of using circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for diseases. Furthermore, some studies demonstrated that circulating miRNAs may serve as novel extracellular communicators of cell-cell communication.

Integrating such data offers an unprecedented opportunity to assess molecular interactions at multiple functional levels and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways involved in different diseases subgroups. However, multiple omics data integration is a challenging task due to the heterogeneity in the different platforms used. There is a need to address the complex and correlated nature of different data-types, in order to identify a robust and reliable multi-omics signature that can predict a phenotype of interest.
We introduce a novel multivariate dimension reduction method for multiple omics integration, classification and identification of a multi-omics molecular signature. DIABLO - Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using a Latent component method for Omics studies, models the correlation structure between omics datasets, resulting in an improved ability to associate biomarkers across multiple functional levels to phenotypes of interest. We demonstrate the capabilities of DIABLO using simulated data and studies of breast cancer and asthma, integrating up to four types of omics datasets to identify relevant biomarkers, while still retaining competitive classification and predictive performance compared to existing methods.
Our statistical integrative framework can benefit a diverse range of research areas with varying types of study designs, as well as enabling module-based analyses. Importantly, graphical outputs of our method assist in the interpretation of such complex analyses and provide significant biological insights.},

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature’) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

The volume of omics data produced is constantly increasing, and so too does the collection of tools for its analysis. Comparative studies assessing performance and the biological value of results, however, are rare but in great demand. We present a comprehensive comparison of three integrative analysis approaches, sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and logic data mining MicroArray Logic Analyzer (MALA), by applying them to simulated and experimental omics data. We find that sCCA and NMF are able to identify differential features in simulated data, while the Logic Data Mining method, MALA, falls short. Applied to experimental data, we show that MALA performs best in terms of sample classification accuracy, and in general, the classification power of prioritized feature sets is high (97.1–99.5\% accuracy). The proportion of features identified by at least one of the other methods, however, is approximately 60\% for sCCA and NMF and nearly 30\% for MALA, and the proportion of features jointly identified by all methods is only around 16\%. Similarly, the congruence on functional levels (Gene Ontology, Reactome) is low. Furthermore, the agreement of identified feature sets with curated gene signatures relevant to the investigated disease is modest. We discuss possible reasons for the moderate overlap of identified feature sets with each other and with curated cancer signatures. The R code to create simulated data, results and figures is provided at https://github.com/ThallingerLab/IamComparison.},

To achieve proper integration, joint Dimensionality Reduction (jDR) methods are among the most efficient approaches. However, several jDR methods are available, urging the need for a comprehensive benchmark with practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of nine representative jDR methods using three complementary benchmarks. First, we evaluate their performances in retrieving ground-truth sample clustering from simulated multi-omics datasets. Second, we use TCGA cancer data to assess their strengths in predicting survival, clinical annotations and known pathways/biological processes. Finally, we assess their classification of multi-omics single-cell data. From these in-depth comparisons, we observe that intNMF performs best in clustering, while MCIA offers an effective behavior across many contexts.

We have previously reported that this receptor exhibits tumor suppressor properties in neuroblastoma. We have now assessed cinacalcet, an allosteric activator of the CaSR approved for clinical use, as targeted therapy for this developmental tumor using neuroblastoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) with different MYCN and TP53 status. In vitro, acute exposure to cinacalcet induced endoplasmic reticulum stress coupled to apoptosis via ATF4-CHOP-TRB3 in CaSR-positive, MYCN-amplified cells. Both phenotypes were partially abrogated by phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. Prolonged in vitro treatment also promoted dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in CaSR-positive, MYCN-amplified cells and, irrespective of MYCN status, differentiation in surviving cells. Cinacalcet significantly inhibited tumor growth in MYCN-amplified xenografts and reduced that of MYCN-non amplified PDX. Morphology assessment showed fibrosis in MYCN-amplified xenografts exposed to the drug. Microarrays analyses revealed up-regulation of cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) in cinacalcet-treated MYCN-amplified tumors. These were predominantly CTAs encoded by genes mapping on chromosome X, which are the most immunogenic. Other modulated genes upon prolonged exposure to cinacalcet were involved in differentiation, cell cycle exit, microenvironment remodeling and calcium signaling pathways. CTAs were up-regulated in PDX and in vitro models as well. Moreover, progressive increase of CaSR expression upon cinacalcet treatment was seen both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, cinacalcet reduces neuroblastoma tumor growth and up-regulates CTAs. This effect represents a therapeutic opportunity and provides surrogate circulating markers of neuroblastoma response to this treatment.},

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disease caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. With its incidence increasing worldwide, to find a safe approach to permanently cease autoimmunity and allow β-cell recovery has become vital. Relying on the inherent ability of apoptotic cells to induce immunological tolerance, we demonstrated that liposomes mimicking apoptotic β-cells arrested autoimmunity to β-cells and prevented experimental T1D through tolerogenic dendritic cell (DC) generation. These liposomes contained phosphatidylserine (PS)-the main signal of the apoptotic cell membrane-and β-cell autoantigens. To move toward a clinical application, PS-liposomes with optimum size and composition for phagocytosis were loaded with human insulin peptides and tested on DCs from patients with T1D and control age-related subjects. PS accelerated phagocytosis of liposomes with a dynamic typical of apoptotic cell clearance, preserving DCs viability. After PS-liposomes phagocytosis, the expression pattern of molecules involved in efferocytosis, antigen presentation, immunoregulation, and activation in DCs concurred with a tolerogenic functionality, both in patients and control subjects. Furthermore, DCs exposed to PS-liposomes displayed decreased ability to stimulate autologous T cell proliferation. Moreover, transcriptional changes in DCs from patients with T1D after PS-liposomes phagocytosis pointed to an immunoregulatory prolife. Bioinformatics analysis showed 233 differentially expressed genes. Genes involved in antigen presentation were downregulated, whereas genes pertaining to tolerogenic/anti-inflammatory pathways were mostly upregulated. In conclusion, PS-liposomes phagocytosis mimics efferocytosis and leads to phenotypic and functional changes in human DCs, which are accountable for tolerance induction. The herein reported results reinforce the potential of this novel immunotherapy to re-establish immunological tolerance, opening the door to new therapeutic approaches in the field of autoimmunity.},

	abstract = {Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite continuous advances, the identification of key molecular signatures in the hyper-acute phase of ischemic stroke is still a primary interest for translational research on stroke diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Data integration from high-throughput -omics techniques has become crucial to unraveling key interactions among different molecular elements in complex biological contexts, such as ischemic stroke. Thus, we used advanced data integration methods for a multi-level joint analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data sets obtained from mouse brains at 2 h after cerebral ischemia. By modeling net-like correlation structures, we identified an integrated network of genes and proteins that are differentially expressed at a very early stage after stroke. We validated 10 of these deregulated elements in acute stroke, and changes in their expression pattern over time after cerebral ischemia were described. Of these, CLDN20, GADD45G, RGS2, BAG5, and CTNND2 were next evaluated as blood biomarkers of cerebral ischemia in mice and human blood samples, which were obtained from stroke patients and patients presenting stroke-mimicking conditions. Our findings indicate that CTNND2 levels in blood might potentially be useful for distinguishing ischemic strokes from stroke-mimicking conditions in the hyper-acute phase of the disease. Furthermore, circulating GADD45G content within the first 6 h after stroke could also play a key role in predicting poor outcomes in stroke patients. For the first time, we have used an integrative biostatistical approach to elucidate key molecules in the initial stages of stroke pathophysiology and highlight new notable molecules that might be further considered as blood biomarkers of ischemic stroke.},

The use of high-throughput unbiased omics approaches and the integration of these data might deepen the knowledge of stroke at the molecular level, depicting the interaction between different molecular units. We aimed to identify protein and gene expression changes in the human brain after ischemia through an integrative approach to join the information of both omics analyses. The translational potential of our results was explored in a pilot study with blood samples from ischemic stroke patients. Proteomics and transcriptomics discovery studies were performed in human brain samples from six deceased stroke patients, comparing the infarct core with the corresponding contralateral brain region, unveiling 128 proteins and 2716 genes significantly dysregulated after stroke. Integrative bioinformatics analyses joining both datasets exposed canonical pathways altered in the ischemic area, highlighting the most influential molecules. Among the molecules with the highest fold-change, 28 genes and 9 proteins were selected to be validated in five independent human brain samples using orthogonal techniques. Our results were confirmed for NCDN, RAB3C, ST4A1, DNM1L, A1AG1, A1AT, JAM3, VTDB, ANXA1, ANXA2, and IL8. Finally, circulating levels of the validated proteins were explored in ischemic stroke patients. Fluctuations of A1AG1 and A1AT, both up-regulated in the ischemic brain, were detected in blood along the first week after onset. In summary, our results expand the knowledge of ischemic stroke pathology, revealing key molecules to be further explored as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Biological systems function through complex interactions between various ‘omics (biomolecules), and a more complete understanding of these systems is only possible through an integrated, multi-omic perspective. This has presented the need for the development of integration approaches that are able to capture the complex, often non-linear, interactions that define these biological systems and are adapted to the challenges of combining the heterogenous data across ‘omic views. A principal challenge to multi-omic integration is missing data because all biomolecules are not measured in all samples. Due to either cost, instrument sensitivity, or other experimental factors, data for a biological sample may be missing for one or more ‘omic techologies. Recent methodological developments in artificial intelligence and statistical learning have greatly facilitated the analyses of multi-omics data, however many of these techniques assume access to completely observed data. A subset of these methods incorporate mechanisms for handling partially observed samples, and these methods are the focus of this review. We describe recently developed approaches, noting their primary use cases and highlighting each method's approach to handling missing data. We additionally provide an overview of the more traditional missing data workflows and their limitations; and we discuss potential avenues for further developments as well as how the missing data issue and its current solutions may generalize beyond the multi-omics context.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers, three fibroadenomas, and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. As reported previously, the cancers could be classified into a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups, each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets: first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect intrinsic properties of the tumors and, second, a gene set that highly correlated with patient outcome. Survival analyses on a subcohort of patients with locally advanced breast cancer uniformly treated in a prospective study showed significantly different outcomes for the patients belonging to the various groups, including a poor prognosis for the basal-like subtype and a significant difference in outcome for the two estrogen receptor-positive groups.},

Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at {\textgreater}10\% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Due to the current high availability of omics, data-driven biology has greatly expanded, and several papers have reviewed state-of-the-art technologies. Nowadays, two main types of investigation are available for a multi-omics dataset: extraction of relevant features for a meaningful biological interpretation and clustering of the samples. In the latter case, a few reviews refer to some outdated or no longer available methods, whereas others lack the description of relevant clustering metrics to compare the main approaches. This work provides a general overview of the major techniques in this area, divided into four groups: graph, dimensionality reduction, statistical and neural-based. Besides, eight tools have been tested both on a synthetic and a real biological dataset. An extensive performance comparison has been provided using four clustering evaluation scores: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Davies-Bouldin(DB) index, Silhouette value and the harmonic mean of cluster purity and efficiency. The best results were obtained by using the dimensionality reduction, either explicitly or implicitly, as in the neural architecture.},
