	abstract = {In the context of systems biology, few sparse approaches have been proposed so far to integrate several data sets. It is however an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as to understand the mutual interactions between the different data sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial to give interpretable results. We focus on a sparse Partial Least Squares approach (sPLS) to handle two-block data sets, where the relationship between the two types of variables is known to be symmetric. Sparse PLS has been developed either for a regression or a canonical correlation framework and includes a built-in procedure to select variables while integrating data. To illustrate the canonical mode approach, we analyzed the NCI60 data sets, where two different platforms (cDNA and Affymetrix chips) were used to study the transcriptome of sixty cancer cell lines.},

	abstract = {Rapid development of DNA microarray technology has resulted in different laboratories adopting numerous different protocols and technological platforms, which has severely impacted on the comparability of array data. Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. CIA simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. CIA can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses.},

These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.},

This review covers those methods that have been used over the past decade to statistically integrate and interpret metabolomics and transcriptomic data sets. It defines four categories of approaches, correlation-based integration, concatenation-based integration, multivariate-based integration and pathway-based integration, into which all existing statistical methods fit. It also explores the choices in study design for generating samples for analysis by these omics technologies and the impact that these technical decisions have on the subsequent data analysis options.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The functional interpretation of microarray datasets still represents a time-consuming and challenging task. Up to now functional categories that are relevant for one or more experimental context(s) have been commonly extracted from a set of regulated genes and presented in long lists.Results: To facilitate interpretation, we integrated Gene Ontology (GO) annotations into Correspondence Analysis to display genes, experimental conditions and gene-annotations in a single plot. The position of the annotations in these plots can be directly used for the functional interpretation of clusters of genes or experimental conditions without the need for comparing long lists of annotations. Correspondence Analysis is not limited in the number of experimental conditions that can be compared simultaneously, allowing an easy identification of characterizing annotations even in complex experimental settings. Due to the rapidly increasing amount of annotation data available, we apply an annotation filter. Hereby the number of displayed annotations can be significantly reduced to a set of descriptive ones, further enhancing the interpretability of the plot. We validated the method on transcription data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Availability: The M-CHiPS software is accessible for collaborators at http://www.mchips.orgContact:  c.busold@dkfz.deSupplementary information:  http://www.dkfz.de/mchips/supplements/supplement\_busold\_bioinf\_OS.pdf},
