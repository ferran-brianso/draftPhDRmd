Alles Gescheite ist schon gedacht worden.\
Man muss nur versuchen, es noch einmal zu denken.

All intelligent thoughts have already been thought;\
what is necessary is only to try to think them again.

# Conclusion {-}
If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

## Conclusion 1 {-}
The need for a better biological interpretation of multi-omics integrative methods let us to consider the inclusion of biological information during (not after) the analysis process

## Conclusion 2 {-}
We propose a method focused on the expansion of the starting omics datasets, by adding new annotation-derived features to those matrices, before applying the integrative analysis

## Conclusion 3 {-}
This approach allows the inclusion of relevant information from the main biological annotation tools, as well as any custom annotation, combined with the use our preferred Dimension Reduction techniques

## Conclusion 4 {-}
We have implemented a pipeline for reproducible and easy-to-use execution, that facilitates the control of each step, the visualization of results and their reporting to PDF/HTML formats.

## More info {-}
And here's some other random info: 
the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. 
Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.

This paragraph, by contrast, *will* be indented as it should because it is not the first one after the 'More info' heading.
All hail LaTeX. (If you're reading the HTML version, you won't see any indentation - have a look at the PDF version to understand what in the earth this section is babbling on about).
